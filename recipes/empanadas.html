    <h4>This empanada recipe was given to me by a visiting Argentine professor while I was studying Spanish in college. They have become a staple food in my household; they are simple to make and delicious.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound yellow onions, chopped</li>
        <li>6 scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>36 empanada pastry discs</li>
        <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, scallions, and bell pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, oregano, salt, cayenne pepper, and cumin to the pot. Cook and stir beef until no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, then cover and place in the refrigerator until meat is completely cooled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove filling from the refrigerator and transfer to a colander to drain. Return filling to the Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Liberally grease a baking sheet with butter.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 tablespoons filling into the center of empanada disk. Fold empanada in half into a crescent shape, press the edges of dough together with a fork or your fingers to seal, and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining empanadas and filling. Brush tops with egg white.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
